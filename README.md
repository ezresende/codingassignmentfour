# codingassignmentfour
Is intended to host the coding assessment that ends Module 05 of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript course at the Johns Hopkins University.

The project aims to create a simple first page of a website - containing a navigation bar, with a menu and some responsiveness. The design and visual identity follow what was established by the teacher in the classes.
